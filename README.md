Fetch media from Instagraman API
================

Personal Projects

-Fetch content from tags:

This is a very simple app which shows how to connect to the existing Instagram API services to fetch some data from it. 
For the sake of keep everything simpler I am not implementing any logic related with OAuth 2.0 protocol which is very
simple to use it so feel free to add it if you want to contribute.

Hope you can find this sample helpful for what you are looking for.

NOTE: In order to run this project you will need a CLIENT ID from Instagram Developer website.

Cheers!
